    WARNING: Lua-eSpeak stills under development AND MUST BE CONSIDERED
            AS BETA QUALITY. If you find a bug, please report me. 


+ Introduction

eSpeak is a compact open source software speech synthesizer for English and
other languages. It produces good quality English speech using a different
synthesis method from other open source TTS engines. 

Lua-eSpeak is a "binding": a library that exports functions from eSpeak to
the Lua Programming Language, allowing you to use eSpeak from Lua. The API
was NOT literally exported, but changed in a way that make it familiar to
Lua users. 

Lua-eSpeak is a programming library, not a synthesis program. If you are
looking for that or are not familiar to the Lua Programming Language, you
are in the wrong place.
